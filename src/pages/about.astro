            <span slot="header">üíÅ A lot of info about me</span>
            Actually, my name is <span class="accent-text font-bold">Korney</span>. I'm studying in Russia and actively involved in what‚Äôs called programming.
            I dedicate a lot of time to <span class="accent-text">data analysis</span> & <span class="accent-text">backend development</span>.
            Unfortunately, I had to learn Astro because of <a class="accent-link" href="https://fxgn.dev">@flexagoon</a>; truth be told, I hate frontend üëé
            Over two years of dedicated development, I've created numerous projects, which you can read about in my <code><a href="https://github.com/ultrageopro/ultrageopro">README</a></code>. 
            I‚Äôm most proud of my <span class="accent-text">VPN service</span> <a class="accent-link" href="https://ultrageovpn.ru">ultrageovpn.ru</a>, <span class="accent-text">self-hosted services</span>
            (i think my server is going to explode soon), and my ability to passionately dislike frontend development.
            <br>
            <strong><span class="accent-text">üëÄ A bit about myself</span></strong> 
            <br>
            I absolutely love the bands <a href="https://www.cagetheelephant.com/music/" class="accent-link">Cage The Elephant</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb" class="accent-link">Radiohead</a>. Their songs are really <i>cool</i> and filled with <i>deep meaning</i>, and, thankfully, it‚Äôs not Taylor Swift.
            <br>
            Besides programming, I really enjoy studying <span class="accent-text">mathematics</span>, going to <span class="accent-text">exhibitions</span> and <span class="accent-text">theaters</span> (depending on my mood), and reading <span class="accent-text">philosophical treatises</span>.
            My favorite film is <a href="" class="accent-link">Interstellar</a>. I think it‚Äôs the best movie of all time.
            <br>
            On this site, you‚Äôll find some of <a href="/blog" class="accent-link">my posts and articles</a> on various topics!
