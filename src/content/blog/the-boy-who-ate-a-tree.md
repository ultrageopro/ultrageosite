# The Boy Who Ate a Tree

![i think he will die soon](https://i.ibb.co/CtnxB8R/image.png)

Once upon a time, in a small village in China, there lived a young boy named **Wei**. Wei was always curious about the world around him and loved to listen to the wise tales his grandmother told him. She often spoke of great heroes, magical creatures, and the secrets of nature. 

One night, while sitting by the fire, Wei’s grandmother told him a story about a _mythical tree_ deep in the forest. She claimed that _whoever ate its bark would gain wisdom beyond their years and grow up strong and wise_.

Wei, who dreamed of becoming wiser and more powerful, decided to find this tree. Early the next morning, before the sun had fully risen, he set off into the forest. After hours of searching, he finally spotted an _ancient-looking tree with thick, twisted roots and dark bark that seemed to glow faintly in the shade_. Certain this was the magical tree his grandmother had spoken of, Wei eagerly scraped off some bark and ate it.

The bark was **bitter and tough**, and it took all of Wei’s willpower to swallow it. But he didn’t mind; he was sure he’d soon feel the effects of wisdom and strength flowing through him. Day after day, he returned to the tree and ate more bark, hoping he would see a change. Yet, _nothing happened_. Wei stayed just as small and youthful as before, his mind as lively and full of questions as ever.

Finally, frustrated and confused, Wei returned to his grandmother and asked, **"Why didn’t the tree make me wiser or stronger? Why haven’t I grown up?"**

His grandmother smiled kindly and replied, 

> "Ah, my dear Wei, wisdom and strength don’t come from eating the bark of any tree. They grow within you as you learn, practice patience, and face life’s challenges. You wanted to become wise quickly, but wisdom is something that comes with time and experience."

Wei looked down, feeling a bit foolish, but his grandmother gently took his hand.

> **"Remember, Wei,"** she said, **"the journey to wisdom isn’t a shortcut. It’s a path you walk each day. Trust in your own heart and mind, and in time, you’ll grow into the wise and strong person you want to be."**

From that day on, Wei understood the true lesson: no shortcut could replace the journey itself.
